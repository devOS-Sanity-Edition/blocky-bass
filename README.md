# Blocky Bass
Have you ever wanted a nondescript wall-mounted singing fish that may or may not be a big mouth bass in your Minecraft world?  No?  Too bad, because Blocky Bass is here!


Fish him out of the water, feed him a music disc, and watch him sing along, or power him with redstone for non-stop fun!  (He may be bad at lip-syncing, but it's the thought that counts.)
